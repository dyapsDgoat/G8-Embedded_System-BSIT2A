Technology Observations
According to EE Times, in 2019, 32% of the embedded market is used in industrial automation. In addition, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) were the most dominant user accounting for 41% of usage. One of the common uses of embedded systems is in smart factories and manufacturing to control systems and manage factory machinery and equipment that is used in the manufacturing process of a component or a product. The embedded system takes inputs from the sensors to obtain data that include heat, humidity, pressure, and light and is then measured, analyzed, and aggregated by a local embedded system. These data then can be sent to the cloud so manufacturers can remotely monitor and control their manufacturing process.
Another usage of embedded systems is in Agricultural automation and irrigation. The variety of sensors, such as soil wetness sensor, humidity sensors, and temperature sensors gather information and send it to the embedded system. The embedded system can decide when and how to irrigate the plants. For example, if the sensor detects that a selection of crops are wet, the embedded system can irrigate that portion of the plants.
On the other hand, one of the lowest usage of embedded system in the market is in the security area, accounting for only 8% of the embedded market. According to Ravishanker et al.(2021), Embedded systems are equipped with an operating system tailored for a particular application. Unlike standard computer systems, the conventional security measures used for general computers are inadequate for embedded systems. As a result, any security breaches can have severe consequences, potentially causing significant harm to both the system itself and its surrounding environment. Ensuring security for embedded systems falls under the responsibility of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which can be a costly endeavor.
